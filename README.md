# Bike-Stores-Data-Analysis


I have included a project where I worked with databases and used SQL to retrieve data. I then imported the data into Excel to clean it up and make it ready for analysis. With Excel's pivot table feature, I created an interactive dashboard that shows revenue information by year, month, state, stores, category, top customers, and sales representative.

To make the project even more visually appealing and user-friendly, I also recreated the dashboard in Tableau. This allowed me to create beautiful visualizations and present the data in an easy-to-understand way.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in using SQL, Excel, and Tableau to work with data, clean it, and create interactive dashboards. It shows my ability to analyze data and present insights that can help in making informed decisions
